# AlgorithmPractice
Projects to practice working with parametric and non-parametric algorithms. These are heavily based on tutorials by [Nick Becker](https://github.com/beckernick), but they're all written in Python 3 (as opposed to the originals programed in Python 2).

# logtistic_regression.py
This is a logistic regression program built from scratch. This was a great opportunity to brush up on my Calc III and Linear Algebra. I used [this](https://beckernick.github.io/logistic-regression-from-scratch/) tutorial.

# convolution.py
Work in progress. . .

# Installation
To run these programs, you'll need the following packages: `numpy matplotlib Pillow scipy scikit-image requests future`
