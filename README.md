# Algorithm Practice
Projects to practice working with parametric and non-parametric algorithms. These are heavily based on tutorials by [Nick Becker](https://github.com/beckernick) and the online book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by [Michael Nielsen](https://michaelnielsen.org/), but they're all written in Python 3 (as opposed to the originals programed in Python 2).

# convolution.py
This program uses matrix algebra to apply transformations to a given image, while building some of the functionality of TensorFlow from scratch. I used [this](https://beckernick.github.io/convolutions/) tutorial.

# logtistic_regression.py
This is a logistic regression program built from scratch. This was a great opportunity to brush up on my Calc III and Linear Algebra. I used [this](https://beckernick.github.io/logistic-regression-from-scratch/) tutorial.

# neural_net.py
This is a neural network built from scratch. Working with fundamental concepts like gradient descent, backpropagation, and more. Most of the process was referenced from [this](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) chapter.

# neural_net_tf.py
This is a neural network built within TensorFlow. Currently on hiatus while pursuing another project.

# Installation
To run these programs, you'll need the following packages in your Python 3.5â€“3.8 enviornment:<br>`numpy matplotlib sklearn Pillow scipy scikit-image requests future tensorflow`
