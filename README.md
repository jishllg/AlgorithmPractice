# logtistic_regression.py
This is a logistic regression program built from scratch. This was a great opportunity to brush up on my Calc III and Linear Algebra. It's heavily based on [this](https://beckernick.github.io/logistic-regression-from-scratch/) tutorial by [Nick Becker](https://github.com/beckernick).

# Installation
To run these programs, you'll need the following packages: `numpy matplotlib PIL scipy skimage requests StringIO __future__`
